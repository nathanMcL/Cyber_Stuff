My Python Educational Cybersecurity Toolkit
This collection offers a suite of cybersecurity tools written in Python, encompassing both educational aspects of encryption and practical applications for secure communications:

Brute Force Caesar Cipher Attack Program: An analytical tool designed to decrypt Caesar cipher-encoded messages by systematically trying all possible shift values until the original message is discovered.

Caesar Cipher GUI: A user-friendly graphical interface allowing users to experiment with the Caesar cipher. It provides functionality to choose a custom shift value, and then encrypt or decrypt messages accordingly.

Custom Password Generator GUI: A utility that facilitates the creation of robust passwords based on user preferences, such as length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters.

SHA-256 Password Generator: Delving into modern cryptographic standards, this tool generates passwords using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, Salting each hash, ensuring a higher level of security and uniqueness for each generated password.

SHA-256 Password Verification Tool: Works hand-in-hand with the SHA-256 Password Generator. This utility checks and confirms if generated passwords align with the original SHA-256 hashing standard, assuring users of the password's integrity.
